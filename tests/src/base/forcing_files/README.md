The shapefile and NetCDF file hosted here are to test downloading data from the Caravan dataset hosted by [4TU.nl](https://doi.org/10.4121/ca13056c-c347-4a27-b320-930c2a4dd207.v1) on their [OpenDAP server](https://opendap.4tu.nl/thredds/catalog/data2/djht/ca13056c-c347-4a27-b320-930c2a4dd207/1/catalog.html).
The data only includes a year of forcing for one catchment.
