    "# User guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a small tutorial of the eWaterCycle platform, showing the concepts in the eWaterCycle platform, and how these are generally used. The experiment shown in this notebook is a straigtforward model run leading to a hydrograph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE: At the moment this tutorial is not functional.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## eWaterCycle platform concept\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In general eWaterCycle tries to strike a balance between making it easy to use standard available elements of an experiment (datasets, models, analysis algorithms), and supplying custom elements. This does mean that a simple usecase sometimes requires slightly more lines of code than strictly nescessary, for the sake of making it easy to adapt this code to more complex and/or custom usecases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Glossary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment: A notebook running one or more hydrological models and producing a scientific result.\n",
    "- Model: Software implementation of an algorithm. Note this excludes data required for this model.\n",
    "- Forcing: all time dependent data needed to run a model, and that is not impacted by the model.\n",
    "- Model Parameters: fixed parameters (depth of river, land use, irrigation channels, dams). Considered constant during a model run.\n",
    "- Parameter Set: File based collection of parameters for a certain model, resolution, and possibly area.\n",
    "- Model instance: single running instance of a model, including all data required, and with a current state.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ingredients of a model instance\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a model instance, we need to select:\n",
    "- A model.\n",
    "- Forcing (usually converted to a model specific format).\n",
    "- Parameters for this model. Some models come with default parameters, most must be explicitly given a parameter set on creation of an instance. Parameters can be overriden in the setup function.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a model instance, eWaterCycle will supply the following:\n",
    "- A configuration file for the model. This is generated from a template for that specific model.\n",
    "- A container for the model. This is found in the collection of model containers\n"

    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to find all needed data and models eWaterCycle comes with a configuration object. This configuration contains system settings for eWaterCycle (which container technology to use, where is the data located, etc). In general these should not need to be changed by the user for a specific experiment, and ideally a user would never need to touch this configuration on a properly managed system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: a path on the local filesystem is always denoted as \"dir\" (short for directory), instead of folder, path, or location. Especially location can be confusing in the context of geospatial modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ESMValTool configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "As eWaterCycle relies on ESMValTool for processing forcing data, configuration for forcing is mostly defered to the esmvaltool configuration file. What ESMValTool configuration file to use can be specified in the eWatercycle configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples of configuration\n",
    "- Where is the grdc data stored?\n",
    "- What container technology is used (singularity or docker)?\n",
    "- Where are the singularity model containers stored locally?\n",
    "- Where are the parameter sets stored?\n",
    "- Where will the (temporary) output data be stored by default?"

    "eWaterCycle can generate forcing for a model using the `forcing` module. This does all the required steps to go from the available datasets (ERA-5, ERA-Interim, etc) to whatever format the model requires for forcing. In general the output should match a forcing prepared \"manually\" for this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "As input for the forcing generation the shape of the required forcing (usually a catchment) is needed. eWaterCycle will derive additiona information such as a bounding box if this is required by the model (e.g. in case of a gridded model), and additional options may be available or even required for some models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forcing module generates a ESMValTool recipe using all the arguments supplied. For most models all computations are done using ESMValTool. However, for some models (e.g. lisflood) additional computation is done, as some steps require data and/or code not available in ESMValTool.\n",
    "\n",
    "The forcing generated is returned in the form of an object with metadata attached, and the main forcing being stored in a directory. This directory can either be specified explicitly, or it will be auto-generated by eWaterCycle from the output dir specified in the configuration. Some additional functionality is available to analyse the forcing, most promonently a plotting function to visually inspect the forcing."
