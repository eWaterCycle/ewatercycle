Plugins
=======

Each model is implemented as a plugin. This allows to easily add new models to
the ewatercycle eco-system. See :doc:`adding_models` for more information on
how to add a new model as a plugin.

Each plugin has its own documentation. Below is a list of all known plugins:

* :doc:`Hype <plugins/hype/index>`
* :doc:`LISFLOOD <plugins/lisflood/index>`
* :doc:`MARRMoT <plugins/marrmot/index>`
* :doc:`PCRGlobWB <plugins/pcrglobwb/index>`
* :doc:`Wflow <plugins/wflow/index>`

.. note::

    To add your plugin to this list, please create a `Pull Request <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle/pulls>`_.

.. TODO move docs/plugins/<model> to docs/ in <model> plugin repo
