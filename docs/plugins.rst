Plugins
=======

Each model is implemented as a plugin. This allows to easily add new models to
the ewatercycle eco-system. See :doc:`adding_models` for more information on
how to add a new model as a plugin.

Each plugin has its own documentation. Below is a list of all known plugins:

* `Hype <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-hype>`_
* `LISFLOOD <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-lisflood>`_
* `MARRMoT <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-marrmot>`_
* `PCRGlobWB <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-pcrglobwb>`_
* `Wflow <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-wflow>`_
* `LeakyBucket <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle-leakybucket>`_

.. note::

    To add your plugin to this list, please create a `Pull Request <https://github.com/eWaterCycle/ewatercycle/pulls>`_.
