        Forcing can be generated for a specifc source by doing

        >>> from ewatercycle.forcing import sources

        A forcing can be generated from files on disk with something like

        >>> from ewatercycle.forcing import sources
        >>> forcing = sources.DefauitForcing(
            directory="path/to/forcing/directory",
            start_time="2000-01-01",
            end_time="2001-12-31",
        )

        A previously saved forcing can be loaded with

        >>> from ewatercycle.forcing import sources
        >>> forcing = sources.DefaultForcing.load("path/to/forcing/directory")

    To get your own forcing source to be listed here it needs to be
    registered in the `ewatercycle.forcings`
    `entry point group <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/entry-points/>`_
